    <p>Benin, Edo State, located in the rainforest region of southern Nigeria, is home to the Benin people, and it is one of Africa’s most historic civilizations. The ancient Benin Kingdom is renowned for its advanced political structure, vibrant festivals, and world-famous bronze and ivory artworks. These masterpieces, many of which are now preserved in museums around the world, are recognized by UNESCO for their cultural significance. The Benin people’s rich traditions and deep-rooted heritage continue to be a proud symbol of Nigeria’s cultural identity.</p>
